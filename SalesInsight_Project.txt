I start with the problem statement where computer hardware manufacturer is facing issues in terms of their sales and then they hire a team of data analysts and 
As a data analysts I first used the AIMS grid (Purpose,Stakeholders,Criteria, End Result) to define a problem and define strategy to tackle that problem and then 
how the work on data discovery the next step was data cleaning and data merging and the next step generating those dashboards in in power bi.I have built this a 
Power BI dashboard where you can track revenue numbers and sales quantity numbers year over year you can also track the revenue breakdown by regions by different 
products and so on and you can also track the revenue trends and Performance Insights.

Used Softwares: MySQL, PowerBI
